React Vite Project
This project is built using React and Vite. Vite is a fast build tool that provides an optimized development experience.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14 or later)
You can check your installed version using:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm (comes with Node.js, but you can use yarn if preferred)
You can check your npm version using:

bash
Copy code
npm -v
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd <project-folder>
npm install
Alternatively, if you prefer Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
3. Run the Development Server
Start the Vite development server to run the React app:

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
If you're using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn dev
This will start the development server, and you can view your application at http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

4. Build for Production
To create a production-ready build of your React app, run:

Copy code
npm run build
For Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn build
This will create a dist/ folder with optimized files for deployment.
